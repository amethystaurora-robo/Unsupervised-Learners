:hospital: ***A Group Project on Machine Learning for Health Survey Data***

This project involved each of four members in a group cleaning a dataset, dealing with missing data, and running supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms against one another.
We compared notes and found that of supervised learning algorithms, random forest performed the best for our dataset. For unuspervised learning, we ended up using k-means clustering.
